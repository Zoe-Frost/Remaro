Hi, my name is Zoe Frost and this is my final repository for the brief New Enterprise in the BMD2ID2 class. 

Remaro is an enterprise that was made in order to help prevent material waste. We are able to do this by allowing people to send their old clothing to us and we re-work it into new clothing.
The main features of this enterprise include the following features, a recycling service, a shop to purchase clothing, and information page for people to ask questions about the process. 

The recycling feature is made so that the donor is able to get something in return, they receive a discount code once we have received the clothes they recycled and can then go on to use the code to get our clothing for a cheaper price!

The limitations of the recycling process include the fact that the user needs to visit their post stores and post boxes in order to send it through to us.
